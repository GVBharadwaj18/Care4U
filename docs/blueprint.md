## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#5DADE2) to instill trust and serenity during emergencies.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECF0F1), providing a soft, non-intrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted green (#A9D6B8) for positive affirmations, checkmarks, and action confirmations.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality.
- Use clear, universally recognized icons to represent hospital departments, medical conditions, and emergency actions.
- Employ a card-based layout for all information displays, ensuring a clean, organized, and easy-to-navigate user interface.
- Subtle, non-distracting animations to guide the user through critical actions, such as highlighting key information or confirming choices. For instance, display loading bars instead of loading wheels, to give a sense of time to users.
